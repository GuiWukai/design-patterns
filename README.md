## SOLID design principles

### Single responsibility principle

The single responsibility principle (SRP) states that every class or module in a program should have responsibility for just a single piece of that program's functionality. Further, the elements of that responsibility should be encapsulated by the responsible class rather than spread out in unrelated classes.

### Open-closed principle

The open/closed principle states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

### Liskov subsitution principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP, lsp) is a concept in Object Oriented Programming that states: Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

### Interface segragation principle

The interface-segregation principle (ISP) states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. ... ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

### Dependency inversion principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
